The project's goal is to display multiple interactive maps with the location and magnitude of earthquakes during the last 7 days around the world.

The Javascript-Leaflet library, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript were used in the project. The Mapbox-API was also used to load the base maps.

The project was divided into two steps with different levels of complexity.

### Step 1: A single base layer and one set of data were used
